<p>Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.</p>
<p>Some changes though are &quot;substantial&quot;, and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Rust and WebAssembly
community.</p>
<p>The &quot;RFC&quot; (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and
controlled path for substantial changes and additions to enter the Rust and
WebAssembly ecosystem, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the
direction the ecosystem is evolving in.</p>

<a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary"><h1>Summary</h1></a>
<p>Adopt a simplified version of the Rust RFC process to the Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group. The RFC process will provide a single place to decide on
substantial changes and additions across the ecosystem for all stakeholders.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>There are some decisions which have broad impact across the Rust and WebAssembly
ecosystem, and therefore have many stakeholders who deserve to have a say in the
decision and provide feedback on proposals and designs. Right now, these
decisions tend to be made in whatever local repository pull request or issue
tracker. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to stay on top of these
decisions, because they need to watch many different places. For a repository
owner or team, it is also difficult to determine whether the ecosystem is in
favor of a feature or not.</p>
<p>After adopting this RFC process, stakeholders should have an easier time staying
on top of substantial changes and features within the ecosystem. Additionally,
the maintainers of a particular repository within the Rust and WebAssembly
ecosystem should feel confident that they've solicited feedback from everyone
involved after going through an RFC, and won't get angry bug reports from users
who felt that they were not consulted. Everyone should have shared confidence in
the direction that the ecosystem evolves in.</p>
<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation" id="detailed-explanation"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>Right now, governance for repositories within the <code>rustwasm</code> organization
<a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/team/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#repositories">follow these rules</a> describing policy for merging pull
requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, each <code>rustwasm/*</code> repository has the following general
policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All pull requests must be reviewed and approved of by at least one relevant
team member or repository collaborator before merging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes,
trade offs, etc are made by the relevant team and/or repository
collaborators consensus. In other words, decisions on things that aren't
straightforward improvements to or bug fixes for things that already exist
in the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This policy categorizes pull requests as either &quot;larger, more nuanced ...&quot;
changes or not (we will use &quot;substantial&quot; from now on). When a change is not
substantial, it requires only a single team member approve of it. When a change
is larger and more substantial, then the relevant team comes to consensus on how
to proceed.</p>
<p>This RFC intends to further sub-categorize substantial changes into those that
affect only maintenance of the repository itself, and are therefore only
substantial <em>internally</em> to the maintainers, versus those substantial changes
that have an impact on <em>external</em> users and the larger Rust and WebAssembly
community. For internally substantial changes, we do not intend to change the
current policy at all. For substantial changes that have external impact, we
will adopt a lightweight version of Rust's RFC process.</p>
<a class="header" href="#when-does-a-change-need-an-rfc" id="when-does-a-change-need-an-rfc"><h2>When does a change need an RFC?</h2></a>
<p>You need to follow the RFC process if you intend to make externally substantial
changes to any repository within the <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm"><code>rustwasm</code> organization</a>, or the RFC
process itself. What constitutes a &quot;substantial&quot; change is evolving based on
community norms and varies depending on what part of the ecosystem you are
proposing to change, but may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of or breaking changes to public APIs in widespread use.</li>
<li>Public API additions that extend the public API in new ways (i.e. more than
&quot;we implement <code>SomeTrait</code> for <code>ThisThing</code>, so also implement <code>SomeTrait</code> for
<code>RelatedThing</code>&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes do not require an RFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise &quot;changing shape does
not change meaning&quot;.</li>
<li>Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria
(warning removal, speedup, better platform coverage, more parallelism, trap
more errors, etc.)</li>
<li>Additions only likely to be <em>noticed by</em> other maintainers, and remain
invisible to users.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through
the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-rfc-process-step-by-step" id="the-rfc-process-step-by-step"><h2>The RFC process step by step</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Fork the <a href="http://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs">RFC repository</a>.</li>
<li>Copy <code>000-template.md</code> to <code>text/000-my-feature.md</code> (where &quot;my-feature&quot; is
descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).</li>
<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present
convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the impact of the design,
or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be
poorly-received.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request, the RFC will receive design feedback
from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in
response.</li>
<li>Each new RFC pull request will be triaged in the next Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group meeting and assigned to one or more of the <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/team/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#teams"><code>@rustwasm/*</code>
teams</a>.</li>
<li>Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are
much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
comments. Feel free to reach out to the RFC assignee in particular to get
help identifying stakeholders and obstacles.</li>
<li>The team(s) will discuss the RFC pull request, as much as possible in the
comment thread of the pull request itself. Offline discussion will be
summarized on the pull request comment thread.</li>
<li>RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives
and drawbacks are shown. You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to
clarify or change the design, but make changes as new commits to the pull
request, and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the
pull request.</li>
<li>At some point, a member of the subteam will propose a &quot;motion for final
comment period&quot; (FCP), along with a <em>disposition</em> for the RFC (merge, close,
or postpone).
<ul>
<li>This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that the
team(s) are in a position to make a decision. That does not require
consensus amongst all participants in the RFC thread (which may be
impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on the RFC
needs to have already been clearly articulated, and there should not be a
strong consensus <em>against</em> that position outside of the team(s). Team
members use their best judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself
ensures there is ample time and notification for stakeholders to push back
if it is made prematurely.</li>
<li>For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP should be preceded by a
<em>summary comment</em> trying to lay out the current state of the discussion and
major tradeoffs/points of disagreement.</li>
<li>Before actually entering FCP, <em>all</em> members of the team(s) must sign off;
this is often the point at which many team members first review the RFC in
full depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The FCP lasts seven calendar days. It is also advertised widely, e.g. in an
issue of <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/">&quot;This Week in Rust and WebAssembly&quot; on the Rust and WebAssembly
blog</a>. This way all stakeholders have a chance to
lodge any final objections before a decision is reached.</li>
<li>In most cases, the FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or
closed. However, sometimes substantial new arguments or ideas are raised,
the FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#from-rfc-to-implementation" id="from-rfc-to-implementation"><h2>From RFC to implementation</h2></a>
<p>Once an RFC is merged it becomes &quot;active&quot; then authors may implement it and
submit the feature as a pull request to the relevant repositories. Being
&quot;active&quot; is not a rubber stamp, and in particular still does not mean the
feature will ultimately be merged; it does mean that in principle all the major
stakeholders have agreed to the feature and are amenable to merging it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is &quot;active&quot; implies
nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor does it imply
anything about whether a developer has been assigned the task of implementing
the feature. While it is not <em>necessary</em> that the author of the RFC also write
the implementation, it is by far the most effective way to see an RFC through to
completion: authors should not expect that other project developers will take on
responsibility for implementing their accepted feature.</p>
<p>Modifications to &quot;active&quot; RFCs can be done in follow-up pull requests. We strive
to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the
feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged
RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next
major release.</p>
<p>In general, once accepted, RFCs should not be substantially changed. Only very
minor changes should be submitted as amendments. More substantial changes should
be new RFCs, with a note added to the original RFC.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives" id="rationale-and-alternatives"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<p>The design space for decision making is very large, from democratic to
autocratic and more.</p>
<p>Forking and simplifying Rust's RFC process is <em>practical</em>. Rather than designing
a decision making process from scratch, we take an existing one that works well
and tailor it to our needs. Many Rust and WebAssembly stakeholders are already
familiar with it.</p>
<p>The main differences from the Rust RFC process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FCP lasts seven calendar days rather than ten. This reflects our desire for a
lighter-weight process that moves more quickly than Rust's RFC process.</li>
<li>The RFC template is shorter and merges together into single sections what were
distinct sections in the Rust RFC template. Again, this reflects our desire
for a lighter-weight process where we do not need to go into quite as much
painstaking detail as Rust RFCs sometimes do (perhaps excluding <em>this</em> RFC).</li>
</ul>
<p>The phases of RFC development and post-RFC implementation are largely the same
as the Rust RFC process. We found that the motivations for nearly every phase of
Rust's RFC process are equally motivating for the Rust and WebAssembly
domain. We expected to simplify phases a lot, for example, we initially
considered removing FCP and going straight to signing off on accepting an RFC or
not. However, FCP exists as a way to (1) allow stakeholders to voice any final
concerns that hadn't been brought up yet, and (2) help enforce the &quot;no new
rationale&quot; rule. Both points apply equally well to the Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group and ecosystem as they apply to Rust itself.</p>
<p>We can also avoid adopting an RFC process, and move more quickly by allowing
each repository's team or owner to be dictators of their corner of the
ecosystem. However, this will result in valuable feedback, opinions, and insight
not getting voiced, and narrow decisions being made.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions" id="unresolved-questions"><h1>Unresolved Questions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will we use <a href="https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs"><code>@rfcbot</code></a>? If we can, we probably should, but this can
be decided separately from whether to accept this RFC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to best advertise new RFCs and FCP? Should we make &quot;This Week in Rust and
WebAssembly&quot; actually be weekly rather than every other week? The interaction
between FCP length and frequency of TWiRaWA posting seems important.</p>

<a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1"><h1>Summary</h1></a>
<p>Support defining single inheritance relationships in <code>wasm-bindgen</code>'s imported
types. Specifically, we define static upcasts from a derived type to one of its
base types, checked dynamic casts from a type to any other type using
JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator, and finally unchecked casts between any
JavaScript types as an escape hatch for developers. For the proc-macro frontend,
this is done by adding the <code>#[wasm_bindgen(extends = Base)]</code> attribute to the
derived type. For the WebIDL frontend, WebIDL's existing interface inheritance
syntax is used.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation-1" id="motivation-1"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>Prototype chains and ECMAScript classes allow JavaScript developers to define
single inheritance relationships between types. <a href="https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-inherit">WebIDL interfaces can inherit
from one another,</a> and Web APIs make widespread use of this
feature. We want to support calling base methods on an imported derived type and
passing an imported derived type to imported functions that expect a base type
in <code>wasm-bindgen</code>. We want to support dynamically checking whether some JS value
is an instance of a JS class, and dynamically-checked casts. Finally, the same
way that <code>unsafe</code> provides an encapsulatable escape hatch for Rust's ownership
and borrowing, we want to provide unchecked (but safe!) conversions between JS
classes and values.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stakeholders" id="stakeholders"><h1>Stakeholders</h1></a>
<p>Anyone who is using <code>wasm-bindgen</code> directly or transitively through the
<code>web-sys</code> crate is affected. This does <em>not</em> affect the larger wasm ecosystem
outside of Rust (eg Webpack). Therefore, the usual advertisement of this RFC on
<em>This Week in Rust and WebAssembly</em> and at our working group meetings should
suffice in soliciting feedback.</p>

<p>Consider the following JavaScript class definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class MyBase { }
class MyDerived extends MyBase { }
</code></pre>
<p>We translate this into <code>wasm-bindgen</code> proc-macro imports like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    pub extern type MyBase;

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]
    pub extern type MyDerived;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note the <code>#[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]</code> annotation on <code>extern type MyDerived</code>. This tells <code>wasm-bindgen</code> that <code>MyDerived</code> inherits from <code>MyBase</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could describe these same classes as WebIDL interfaces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-webidl">interface MyBase {}
interface MyDerived : MyBase {}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-upcasting" id="example-upcasting"><h3>Example Upcasting</h3></a>
<p>We can upcast into a <code>MyBase</code> from a <code>MyDerived</code> type using the normal <code>From</code>,
<code>AsRef</code>, <code>AsMut</code>, and <code>Into</code> conversions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-dynamically-checked-casting" id="example-dynamically-checked-casting"><h3>Example Dynamically-Checked Casting</h3></a>
<p>We can do dynamically-checked (checked with JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator)
downcasts from a <code>MyBase</code> into a <code>MyDerived</code> using the <code>dyn_{into,ref,mut}</code>
methods:</p>
<pre><code>let base: MyBase = get_base_from_somewhere();
match base.dyn_into::&lt;MyDerived&gt;() {
    Ok(derived) =&gt; {
        // It was an instance of `MyDerived`!
    }
    Err(base) =&gt; {
        // It was some other kind of instance of `MyBase`.
    }
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-unchecked-casting" id="example-unchecked-casting"><h3>Example Unchecked Casting</h3></a>
<p>If we really know that a <code>MyBase</code> is an instance of <code>MyDerived</code> and we don't
want to pay the cost of a dynamic check, we can also use unchecked conversions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();

// We know that this is a `MyDerived` since we *just* converted it into `MyBase`
// from `MyDerived` above.
let derived: MyDerived = base.unchecked_into();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Unchecked casting serves as an escape hatch for developers, and while it can
lead to JavaScript exceptions, it cannot create memory unsafety.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-jscast-trait" id="the-jscast-trait"><h2>The <code>JsCast</code> Trait</h2></a>
<p>For dynamically-checked and unchecked casting between arbitrary JavaScript
types, we introduce the <code>JsCast</code> trait. It requires implementations provide a
boolean predicate that consults JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator, as well as
unchecked conversions from JavaScript values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait JsCast {
    fn instanceof(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; bool;

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -&gt; Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; &amp;Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &amp;mut JsValue) -&gt; &amp;mut Self;

    // ... provided methods elided ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>JsCast</code>'s required trait methods are not intended to be used to directly, but
instead are leveraged by its provided methods. Users of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will be
able to ignore <code>JsCast</code>'s required trait methods for the most part, since the
implementations will be mechanically generated, and they will only be using the
required trait methods indirectly through the more ergonomic provided methods.</p>
<p>For every <code>extern { type Illmatic; }</code> imported with <code>wasm-bindgen</code>, we emit an
implementation of <code>JsCast</code> similar to this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl JsCast for Illmatic {
    fn instanceof(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; bool {
        #[cfg(all(target_arch = &quot;wasm32&quot;, not(target_os = &quot;emscripten&quot;)))]
        #[wasm_import_module = &quot;__wbindgen_placeholder__&quot;]
        extern {
            fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(idx: u32) -&gt; u32;
        }

        #[cfg(not(all(target_arch = &quot;wasm32&quot;, not(target_os = &quot;emscripten&quot;))))]
        unsafe extern fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(_: u32) -&gt; u32 {
            panic!(&quot;function not implemented on non-wasm32 targets&quot;)
        }

        __wbindgen_instance_of_MyDerived(val.idx) == 1
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -&gt; Illmatic {
        Illmatic {
            obj: val,
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; &amp;Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &amp;*(val as *const JsValue as *const Illmatic)
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &amp;mut JsValue) -&gt; &amp;mut Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &amp;mut *(val as *mut JsValue as *mut Illmatic)
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Additionally, <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will emit this JavaScript definition of
<code>__wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic</code> that simply wraps the JS <code>instanceof</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic = function (idx) {
  return getObject(idx) instanceof Illmatic;
};

<a class="header" href="#drawbacks" id="drawbacks"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>We might accidentally <em>encourage</em> using this inheritance instead of the more
Rust-idiomatic usage of traits.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-1" id="rationale-and-alternatives-1"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We could define an <code>Upcast</code> trait instead of using the standard <code>From</code> and
<code>As{Ref,Mut}</code> traits. This would make it more clear that we are doing
inheritance-related casts, but would also be a new trait that folks would have
to understand vs pretty much every Rust programmer's familiarity with the
<code>std</code> traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upcasting using the <code>From</code> and <code>As{Ref,Mut}</code> traits does not provide
chainable, turbofishing methods on <code>self</code> that one could use when type
inference needs a helping hand. Instead, one must create a local variable with
an explicit type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// Can't do this with upcasting.
get_some_js_type()
  .into::&lt;AnotherJsType&gt;()
  .method();

// Have to do this:
let another: AnotherJsType = get_some_js_type().into();
another.method();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we used a custom <code>Upcast</code> trait, we could provide turbofishable methods on
<code>self</code>, at the cost of using non-standard traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could use <code>TryFrom</code> for dynamically-checked casts instead of
<code>JsCast::dyn_into</code> et al. This would introduce a new nightly feature
requirement when using <code>wasm-bindgen</code>. We leave the possibility open for when
<code>TryFrom</code> is stabilized by not naming our dynamically-checked cast methods
<code>JsCast::try_into</code> to be future compatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit upcasting still does not provide very good ergonomics. There are a
couple things we could do here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>Deref</code> trait to hide upcasting. This is generally <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/anti_patterns/deref.md">considered an
anti-pattern</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically create a <code>MyBaseMethods</code> trait for base types that contain all
the base type's methods and implement that trait for <code>MyBase</code> and
<code>MyDerived</code>? Also emit a <code>MyDerivedMethods</code> trait that requires <code>MyBase</code> as
a super trait, representing the inheritance at the trait level? This is the
Rust-y thing to do and allows us to write generic functions with trait
bounds. This is what <code>stdweb</code> does with the <code>IHTMLElement</code> trait for
<code>HTMLElement</code>'s methods.</p>
<p>Whether we do this or not also happens to be orthogonal to casting between
base and derived types. We leave exploring this design space to follow up
RFCs, and hope to land just the casting in an incremental fashion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traits sometimes get in the way of learning what one can do with a thing. They
aren't as up-front in the generated documentation, and can lead people to
thinking they <em>must</em> write code that is generic over a trait when it isn't
necessary. There are two ways we could get rid of the <code>JsCast</code> trait:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only implement its methods on <code>JsValue</code> and require that conversions like
<code>ImportedJsClassUno</code> -&gt; <code>ImportedJsClassDos</code> go to <code>JsValue</code> in between:
<code>ImportedJsClassUno</code> -&gt; <code>JsValue</code> -&gt; <code>ImpiortedJsClassDos</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could redundantly implement all its methods on <code>JsValue</code> and imported JS
classes directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unchecked casting could be marked <code>unsafe</code> to reflect that correctness relies
on the programmer in these cases. However, misusing unchecked JS casts cannot
introduce memory unsafety in the Rust sense, so this would be using <code>unsafe</code>
as a general-purpose &quot;you probably shouldn't use this&quot; warning, which is not
<code>unsafe</code>'s intended purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could only implement unchecked casts for everything all the time. This
would encourage a loose, shoot-from-the-hip programming style. We would prefer
leveraging types when possible. We realize that escape hatches are still
required at times, and we do provide arbitrary unchecked casts, but guide
folks towards upcasting with <code>From</code>, <code>AsRef</code>, and <code>AsMut</code> and doing
dynamically checks for other types of casts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions-1" id="unresolved-questions-1"><h1>Unresolved Questions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Should the <code>JsCast</code> trait be re-exported in <code>wasm_bindgen::prelude</code>? We do not
specify that it should be in this RFC, and we can initially ship without
re-exporting it in prelude and see what it feels like. Based on experience, we
may decide in the future to add it to the prelude.</li>

<p>Change <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> to use <code>structural</code> by default, and add a new
attribute <code>final</code> for an opt-in to today's behavior. Once implemented then use
<code>Deref</code> to model the class inheritance hierarchy in <code>web-sys</code> and <code>js-sys</code> to
enable ergonomic usage of superclass methods of web types.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation-2" id="motivation-2"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>The initial motivation for this is outlined <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a>, namely that the <code>web-sys</code>
crate provides bindings for many APIs found on the web but accessing the
functionality of parent classes is quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>The web makes extensive use of class inheritance hierarchies, and in <code>web-sys</code>
right now each class gets its own <code>struct</code> type with inherent methods. These
types implement <code>AsRef</code> between one another for subclass relationships, but it's
quite unergonomic to actually reference the functionality! For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
let y: &amp;Node = x.as_ref();
y.append_child(...);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>or...</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
&lt;Element as AsRef&lt;Node&gt;&gt;::as_ref(x)
    .append_child(...);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>It's be much nicer if we could support this in a more first-class fashion and
make it more ergonomic!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: While this RFC has the same motivation as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a> it's proposing an
alternative solution, specifically enabled by switching by <code>structural</code> by
default, which is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a> but is hopefully formally outlined
here.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation-2" id="detailed-explanation-2"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>This RFC proposes using the built-in <code>Deref</code> trait to model the class hierarchy
found on the web in <code>web-sys</code>. This also proposes changes to <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>
to make using <code>Deref</code> feasible for binding arbitrary JS apis (such as those on
NPM) with <code>Deref</code> as well.</p>
<p>For example, <code>web-sys</code> will contain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Deref for Element {
    type Target = Node;

    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Node { /* ... */ }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>allowing us to write our example above as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
x.append_child(...); // implicit deref to `Node`!
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>All JS types in <code>web-sys</code> and in general have at most one superclass. Currently,
however, the <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> attribute allows specifying multiple <code>extends</code>
attributes to indicate superclasses:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = Node, extends = Object)]
    type Element;

    // ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>web-sys</code> API generator currently lists an <code>extends</code> for all superclasses,
transitively. This is then used in the code generator to generate <code>AsRef</code>
implementatiosn for <code>Element</code>.</p>
<p>The code generation of <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> will be updated with the following
rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no <code>extends</code> attribute is present, defined types will implement
<code>Deref&lt;Target=JsValue&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the <em>first</em> <code>extends</code> attribute is used to implement
<code>Deref&lt;Target=ListedType&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>(long term, currently require a breaking change) reject multiple <code>extends</code>
attributes, requiring there's only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that <code>web-sys</code> may need to be updated to ensure that the immediate
superclass is listed first in <code>extends</code>. Manual bindings will continue to work
and will have the old <code>AsRef</code> implementations as well as a new <code>Deref</code>
implementation.</p>
<p>The <code>Deref</code> implementation will concretely be implemented as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Deref for #imported_type {
    type Target = #target_type;

    #[inline]
    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;#target_type {
        ::wasm_bindgen::JsCast::unchecked_ref(self)
    }
}

<p>If we were to implement the above <code>Deref</code> proposal as-is today in
<code>wasm-bindgen</code>, it would have a crucial drawback. It may not handle inheritance
correctly! Let's explore this with an example. Say we have some JS we'd like to
import:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Parent {
    constructor() {}
    method() { console.log('parent'); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    constructor() {}
    method() { console.log('child'); }
}
</code></pre>
<p>we would then bind this in Rust with:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    type Parent;
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    fn new() -&gt; Parent;
    #[wasm_bindgen(method)]
    fn method(this: &amp;Parent);

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = Parent)]
    type Child;
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    fn new() -&gt; Child;
    #[wasm_bindgen(method)]
    fn method(this: &amp;Child);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and we could then use it like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() {
    let parent = Parent::new();
    parent.method();
    let child = Child::new();
    child.method();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and we would today see <code>parent</code> and <code>child</code> logged to the console. Ok everything
is working as expected so far! We know we've got <code>Deref&lt;Target=Parent&gt; for Child</code>, though, so let's say we tweak this example a bit:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() {
    call_method(&amp;Parent::new());
    call_method(&amp;Child::new());
}

fn call_method(object: &amp;Parent) {
    object.method();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here we'd naively (and correctly) expect <code>parent</code> and <code>child</code> to be output like
before, but much to our surprise this actually prints out <code>parent</code> twice!</p>
<p>The issue with this is how <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> treats method calls today. When you
say:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>then <code>wasm-bindgen</code> (the CLI tool) generates JS that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(obj));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that, by default, <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is <strong>reaching into the
<code>prototype</code> of each class to figure out what method to call</strong>. This in turn
means that when <code>Parent::method</code> is called in Rust, it unconditionally uses the
method defined on <code>Parent</code> rather than walking the protype chain (that JS
usually does) to find the right <code>method</code> method.</p>
<p>To improve the situation there's a <code>structural</code> attribute to wasm-bindgen to fix
this, which when applied like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method, structural)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>means that the following JS code is generated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = function() { this.method(); };

// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that a JS function shim is generated instead of using the raw
function value in the prototype. This, however, means that our example above
will indeed print <code>parent</code> and then <code>child</code> because JS is using prototype
lookups to find the <code>method</code> method.</p>
<p>Phew! Ok with all that information, we can see that <strong>if <code>structural</code> is omitted
then JS class hierarchies can be subtly incorrect when methods taking parent
classes are passed child classes which override methods</strong>.</p>
<p>An easy solution to this problem is to simply use <code>structural</code> everywhere, so...
let's propose that! Consequently, this RFC proposes changing <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>
to act as if all bindings are labeled as <code>structural</code>. While technically a
breaking change it's believed that we don't have any usage which would actually
run into the breakage here.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-wasm_bindgenfinal" id="adding-wasm_bindgenfinal"><h3>Adding <code>#[wasm_bindgen(final)]</code></h3></a>
<p>Since <code>structural</code> is not the default today we don't actually have a name for
the default behavior of <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> today. This RFC proposes adding a new
attribute to <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>, <code>final</code>, which indicates that it should have
today's behavior.</p>
<p>When attached to an attribute or method, the <code>final</code> attribute indicates that
the method or attribute should be processed through the <code>prototype</code> of a class
rather than looked up structurally via the prototype chain.</p>
<p>You can think of this as &quot;everything today is <code>final</code> by default&quot;.</p>
<a class="header" href="#why-is-it-ok-to-make-structural-the-default" id="why-is-it-ok-to-make-structural-the-default"><h3>Why is it ok to make <code>structural</code> the default?</h3></a>
<p>One pretty reasonable question you might have at this point is &quot;why, if
<code>structural</code> is the default today, is it ok to switch?&quot; To answer this, let's
first explore why <code>final</code> is the default today!</p>
<p>From its inception <code>wasm-bindgen</code> has been designed with the future <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host
bindings</a> proposal for WebAssembly. The host bindings proposal promises
faster-than-JS DOM access by removing many of the dynamic checks necessary when
calling DOM methods. This proposal, however, is still in relatively early stages
and hasn't been implemented in any browser yet (as far as we know).</p>
<p>In WebAssembly on the web all imported functions must be plain old JS functions.
They're all currently invoked with <code>undefined</code> as the <code>this</code> parameter. With
host bindings, however, there's a way to say that an imported function uses the
first argument to the function as the <code>this</code> parameter (like <code>Function.call</code> in
JS). This in turn brings the promise of <em>eliminating any shim functions
necessary when calling imported functionality</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, today for <code>#[wasm_bindgen(method)] fn parent(this: &amp;Parent);</code> we
generate JS that looks like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>means that the following JS code is generated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(idx) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(idx));
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we assume for a moment that <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types"><code>anyref</code> is implemented</a> we
could instead change this to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(obj);
}
</code></pre>
<p>(note the lack of need for <code>getObject</code>). And finally, with <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host bindings</a> we
can say that the wasm module's import of <code>__wasm_bindgen_Parent_method</code> uses the
first parameter as <code>this</code>, meaning we can transform this to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method = Parent.prototype.method;
</code></pre>
<p>and <em>voila</em>, no JS function shims necessary! With <code>structural</code> we'll still need
a function shim in this future world:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method = function() { this.method(); };
</code></pre>
<p>Alright, with some of those basics out of the way, let's get back to
why-<code>final</code>-by-default. The promise of <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host bindings</a> is that by eliminating
all these JS function shims necessary we can be faster than we would otherwise
be, providing a feeling that <code>final</code> is faster than <code>structural</code>. This future,
however, relies on a number of unimplemented features in wasm engines today.
Let's consequently get an idea of what the performance looks like today!</p>
<p>I've been slowly over time preparing a <a href="https://alexcrichton.github.io/rust-wasm-benchmark/">microbenchmark suite</a> for measuring
JS/wasm/wasm-bindgen performance. The interesting one here is the benchmark
&quot;<code>structural</code> vs not&quot;. If you click &quot;Run test&quot; in a browser after awhile you'll
see two bars show up. The left-hand one is a method call with <code>final</code> and the
right-hand one is a method call with <code>structural</code>. The results I see on my
computer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 62, <code>structural</code> is 3% faster</li>
<li>Firefox 64, <code>structural</code> is 3% slower</li>
<li>Chrome 69, <code>structural</code> is 5% slower</li>
<li>Edge 42, <code>structural</code> is 22% slower</li>
<li>Safari 12, <code>strutural</code> is 17% slower</li>
</ul>
<p>So it looks like for Firefox/Chrome it's not really making much of a difference
but in Edge/Safari it's much faster to use <code>final</code>! It turns out, however, that
we're not optimizing <code>structural</code> as much as we can. Let's change our generated
code from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = function() { this.method(); };

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(obj));
}
</code></pre>
<p>to...</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    getObject(obj).method();
}
</code></pre>
<p>(manually editing the JS today)</p>
<p>and if we rerun the benchmarks (sorry no online demo) we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 62, <code>structural</code> is 22% faster</li>
<li>Firefox 64, <code>structural</code> is 10% faster</li>
<li>Chrome 69, <code>structural</code> is 0.3% slower</li>
<li>Edge 42, <code>structural</code> is 15% faster</li>
<li>Safai 12, <code>structural</code> is 8% slower</li>
</ul>
<p>and these numbers look quite different! There's some strong data here showing
that <code>final</code> <em>is not universally faster today</em> and is actually almost
universally slower (when we optimize <code>structural</code> slightly).</p>
<p>Ok! That's all basically a very long winded way of saying <strong><code>final</code> was the
historical default because we thought it was faster, but it turns out that in JS
engines today it isn't always faster</strong>. As a result, this RFC proposes that it's
ok to make <code>structural</code> the default.</p>
<a class="header" href="#drawbacks-1" id="drawbacks-1"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<p><code>Deref</code> is a somewhat quiet trait with disproportionately large ramifications.
It affects method resolution (the <code>.</code> operator) as well as coercions (<code>&amp;T</code> to
<code>&amp;U</code>). Discovering this in <code>web-sys</code> and/or JS apis in the ecosystem isn't
always the easiest thing to do. It's thought, though, that this aspect of
<code>Deref</code> won't come up very often when using JS apis in practice. Instead most
APIs will work &quot;as-is&quot; as you might expect in JS in Rust as well, with <code>Deref</code>
being an unobtrusive solution for developers to mostly ignore it an just call
methods.</p>
<p>Additionally <code>Deref</code> has the drawback that it's not explicitly designed for
class inheritance hierarchies. For example <code>*element</code> produces a <code>Node</code>,
<code>**element</code> produces an <code>Object</code>, etc. This is expected to not really come up
that much in practice, though, and instead automatic coercions will cover almost
all type conversions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-2" id="rationale-and-alternatives-2"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<p>The primary alternative to this design is <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a>, using traits to model the
inheritance hierarchy. The pros/cons of that proposal are well listed in <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC
